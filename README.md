# Partigon

A Minecraft particle animation library designed to make your life easier.

Create complex particle animations with just a few lines of code!


TODO:
+ Anchor position
+ More property types
+ Copy and mirror particles
+ Change envelopes/unmodifiable properties mid-anim?



To use:

```
maven {
  url = uri("https://repo.gameoholic.xyz/releases")
}
compileOnly("xyz.gameoholic:partigon:version")
```


Add "Partigon" as a `depend` to `plugin.yml`, and add Kotlin and Partigon to your plugins.
